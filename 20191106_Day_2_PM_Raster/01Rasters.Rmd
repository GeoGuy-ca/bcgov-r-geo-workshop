## Overview 

- Raster Basics
- Manipulating Rasters 
- Remote Sensed data 
- ??




## Packages history and tools : 

- `raster` (first released in 2010 Hijman)
- `sp` including  `SpatialGridDataFrame` & `SpatialPixalsDataFrame` data structure
- `stars` : Spatiotemporal Arrays, Raster and Vector Data Cubes (Pebesma).
- helper packages : `fasterize`, `rgdal`, `mapview` 
- tools and bridges (RSAGA, RQGIS, RPYGeon)



## Using Rasters in R : Work flow 

- Rasters cover all types of data - digital elevation model, remote sensed data, lidar and many others. 
- Often switch between raster and vector data sets.
