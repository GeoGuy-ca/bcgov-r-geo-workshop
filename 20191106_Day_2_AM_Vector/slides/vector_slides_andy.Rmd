???
Spatial data divided into two categories: Vector and Raster

- vector data represents the world using points, lines and polygons. 
- discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector data usually have a high level of precision

- raster data divides the surface up into cells of constant size. 
- basis of background images used in web-mapping 
- aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices. 
- Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scalable.
