Spatial data divided into two categories: Vector and Raster

- vector data represents the world using points, lines and polygons. 
- discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector data usually have a high level of precision

- raster data divides the surface up into cells of constant size. 
- basis of background images used in web-mapping 
- aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices. 
- Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scalable.

???

- Simple Features is a standard specification (Open Geospatial Consortium) - 
agreed-upon way to represent vector spatial data
- represent all common vector geometry types : points, lines, polygons and their respective ‘multi’ versions 
- supports geometry collections, which can contain multiple geometry types in a single object. 
- sf supersedes the sp ecosystem, which comprises sp , rgdal for data read/write  and rgeos for spatial operations.

## Reading spatial data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
```


```{r}
airports <- st_read("data/20191106_Day_2_AM_Vector/bc_airports.gpkg", quiet = TRUE)
airports
```

???

go through sf header info:
- size (# features and number of columns/attributes)
- geometry type
- dimension (XY - can have Z and M)
- bbox
- epsg
- proj4

---

```{r}
st_geometry(airports)

st_bbox(airports)

st_crs(airports)
```

---

```{r}
is.data.frame(airports)
st_drop_geometry(airports)
```

---

## CRS: make sure highlight units
